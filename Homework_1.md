# How can be the popular upper in Bilibili?
## 1  Introduction 
We are in the information overloading age. Entertainment applications and e-commerce platforms provide users with a large number of products at all times, each user in the vast amount of information and even redundant information between the need to spend a lot of time to find their own goods, efficiency compared to the previous network is not developed, not only did not improve but reduced a lot, This is the information overload problem that prevails in the WEB 2.0 era. In order to solve this problem, many platforms have established personalized recommendation systems based on big data. Precision recommendations greatly improve user and product matching efficiency. **This is a matching solution from the user's view, and I want to rethink this issue from the perspective of content producers.** When will content producers release products can earn more attentions? <br>
To narrow this question down, I focus the self-media and take the Bilibili as the example. I want to find the right video releasing time for the Bilibili's uppers. Knowing that, the uppers can become popular quite soon. <br>
## 2  Big Data Problem Restatement and Properties
### 2.1 Problem Restatement
For upper, the best time release is the time period that gets the most attention. In order to describe the most attention-watching time, you can judge from the following indicators.  <br>

Indicators | Details
-|- 
Total online users of Bilibili | The more online users, the more people may watch this video 
Total online playback of Bilibili | More playback means the higher the viewing of new videos 
Time and number of times paused throughout the viewing process | More pauses mean that users are less attentive to viewing
Whether the user has long "silent viewing" | If the user does not do video clicks or other actions for a long time, the user can be considered to be using the video as a background and focusing on something else
Number of times a bombshell was written | The more bombshell means that users are more enthusastics in participating
Number of likes | The more likes, the more people focus on
Nunmber of dislikes | The more dislikes, the more people have negative reaction
Number of comments | The more comments, the more people focus on
Content of bombshell | If the users leave the positive bombshell
Content of comments | If the users leave the postive comments

To get the preliminary feelings of how big the data will be, I crawled the number of plays and the number of people online on the Bilibili home page.<br>
