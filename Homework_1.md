# How can be the popular upper in Bilibili?
## 1  Introduction 
We are in the information overloading age. Entertainment applications and e-commerce platforms provide users with a large number of products at all times, each user in the vast amount of information and even redundant information between the need to spend a lot of time to find their own goods, efficiency compared to the previous network is not developed, not only did not improve but reduced a lot, This is the information overload problem that prevails in the WEB 2.0 era. In order to solve this problem, many platforms have established personalized recommendation systems based on big data. Precision recommendations greatly improve user and product matching efficiency. **This is a matching solution from the user's view, and I want to rethink this issue from the perspective of content producers.** When will content producers release products can earn more attentions? <br>
To narrow this question down, I focus the self-media and take the Bilibili as the example. I want to find the right video releasing time for the Bilibili's uppers. Knowing that, the uppers can become popular quite soon. <br>
